# Welcome to the Fused 30 Day Map Challenge ðŸ‘‹

This is the Official Fused.io 30 Day Map challenge repo

All throughout the month of November we're going to add contribution from the Fused team & the community to the [#30DayMapChallenge](https://30daymapchallenge.com/). 

### What is this repo?

This is a collection of [Fused apps](https://docs.fused.io/workbench/app-builder/) that you can explore to see various uses of Fused, from [User Defined Functions](https://docs.fused.io/core-concepts/why/) to various Fused apps

<!-- https://www.fused.io/workbench/apps#app/s/i/fa_5HnNUZU1V8lNWmB7U7jw6R -->
<!-- https://www.fused.io/workbench/apps#app/s/i/fa_5TmHebwz0QwH7z1L1iiaYz -->
You can explore this from your browser [right here](https://www.fused.io/workbench/apps#app/s/i/fa_2bv4fVJBhl34Zy0qcCE3X6)!

<!-- Would be nice to add a video once the Fused app is live? -->

### Quickstart (local)

This is a streamlit-based repo so you can also run this locally.

```
# Start making new virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

You'll need `poetry` & `python>=3.11`
```
poetry install
```

```
streamlit run Fused_30_days.py
```

And you should be good to go!
